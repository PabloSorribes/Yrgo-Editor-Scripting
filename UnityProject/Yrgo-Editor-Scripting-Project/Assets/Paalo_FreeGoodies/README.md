# Adding the package to your project
You can easily add that package to your project by adding this in your `manifest.json`-file, located in the `Packages`-folder of your Unity Project:
```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.paalo.unity-misc-tools": "https://github.com/PabloSorribes/com.paalo.unity-misc-tools.git#0.3.1",
    ...
  }
}
```
